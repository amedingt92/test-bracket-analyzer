"""
Database schema definitions for the March Madness prediction system.

This module contains functions to initialize the SQLite database used by the
pipeline.  It creates tables for games and teams along with simple indices.
In a full implementation you would extend this schema to include additional
tables (e.g. tournament brackets, seeds, injuries, venues) and enforce
foreignâ€‘key relationships.
